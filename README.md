Project Reflections

I completed all the objectives outlined in moodle

Issues encountered

I added audio and it worked when using live server. However when depoloyed on github it doesnt work

I added a logo in the title bar. Again it worked on live server but not when deployed on github

i made an attempt to make my site responsive and mobile freindly with some success, mainly by using the word wrap feature of flexbox. I also

used vw/vh or dvw/dvh where possible but i'm unsure if this is recommended or best practice.

Also my copyright text dissapeared when viewing on mobile, and i wasnt sure how to fix it.

I noticed something interesting on the spaceX website. on mobile the nav bar dissapears and appears in a hamburger menu list.

This is very effective and id love to learn how to do that
